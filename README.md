# Time Capsule
An app that lets you write down your thoughts and messages and send them to yourself and others in the future! A journal and a time machine, combined! Better than sliced bread!

## About Us
We're just a bunch of kids looking to have fun and learn shtuff. And also build a really cool application.

```bash
# Don't judge
print "Hello World"
```

## The Current State of Matters
This is a minimal Electron application based on the [Quick Start Guide](http://electron.atom.io/docs/tutorial/quick-start) within the Electron documentation.

We will slowly be working our way up. Check back for more developments!
